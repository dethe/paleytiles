A toy for playing with animated tiles in SVG, inspired by an [animation](http://blog.ninapaley.com/2013/05/04/morphing-tiles/) by Nina Paley

Also a step-by-step tutorial for doing the same animation using the Canvas, which should work better in Firefox.

* [Step 1](https://dethe.github.io/paleytiles/canvas1.html): set up canvas and draw a triangle, this will eventually be our clipping region
* [Step 2](https://dethe.github.io/paleytiles/canvas2.html): draw some more triangles, which we'll rotate later
* [Step 3](https://dethe.github.io/paleytiles/canvas3.html): rotate all but the clip triangle to a different start position
* [Step 4](https://dethe.github.io/paleytiles/canvas4.html): apply clipping
* [Step 5](https://dethe.github.io/paleytiles/canvas5.html): animate rotation with clipping
* [Step 6](https://dethe.github.io/paleytiles/canvas6.html): animate rotation without clipping to see what is going on
* [Step 7](https://dethe.github.io/paleytiles/canvas7.html): draw to an offscreen canvas to mirror the clipped triangle
* [Step 8](https://dethe.github.io/paleytiles/canvas8.html): add rotation and mirroring to get the first 1/4 tile
* [Step 9](https://dethe.github.io/paleytiles/canvas9.html): mirror to get 1/2 tile
* [Step 10](https://dethe.github.io/paleytiles/canvas10.html): mirror to get full tile
* [Step 11](https://dethe.github.io/paleytiles/canvas11.html): tile the full page with repeating images
